# Graduate-Admission-Prediction-using-SVR-Support-Vector-Regression-
This project aims to predict the chances of admission for students applying to graduate programs based on various parameters such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, and other academic factors. We use Support Vector Regression (SVR) to build an accurate predictive model.

Dataset
The dataset consists of the following parameters:

GRE Score (Graduate Record Examination)

TOEFL Score (Test of English as a Foreign Language)

University Rating (1 to 5)

SOP (Statement of Purpose Strength, 1 to 5)

LOR (Letter of Recommendation Strength, 1 to 5)

CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)

Research (0 = No Research, 1 = Has Research Experience)

Chance of Admit (Target variable, probability of admission between 0 and 1)

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas & NumPy (for data processing)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn (for building the SVR model)




Expected Outcome
A trained Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to predict admission chances

Data visualization and analysis for insights into factors affecting admissions

A web interface (Flask-based) for users to input parameters and get predictions
